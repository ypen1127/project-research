1
0:00:00 --> 0:00:07.760000
 Okay, since we already published the second and the third one, I'm going to post the first one

2
0:00:07.760000 --> 0:00:17.360000
 with me and the sixth one next to it. I can't reach the other side. Can you please turn the

3
0:00:17.360000 --> 0:00:21.280000
 white thing around? I will work on that. Thank you.

4
0:00:29.120000 --> 0:00:41.600000
 I'm sorry, you can only polish the base step is facing you. Okay. Okay, okay. I think I did it

5
0:00:41.600000 --> 0:00:46.320000
 like the first one, the second one and the sixth one. Okay, the high-diago.

6
0:00:49.440000 --> 0:00:50.400000
 High-diago.

7
0:00:54.720000 --> 0:01:03.120000
 All right, how can I help you first? Okay, can you turn the price around?

8
0:01:03.120000 --> 0:01:06.640000
 Please turn it. We'll work on that. Opposites.

9
0:01:06.640000 --> 0:01:08.640000
 Okay.

10
0:01:24.240000 --> 0:01:36.320000
 Oh, okay. I'm going to polish that. So, we have another two surfaces to polish. Can you turn around

11
0:01:36.320000 --> 0:01:48.320000
 that for me? Yes, I can. You can start. Sure.

12
0:01:48.320000 --> 0:02:00.320000
 Do you need any help?

13
0:02:00.320000 --> 0:02:18.400000
 Yeah, go. This trial is like, polish the one facing you. Only this one. Only. Yeah, yeah. So, not the side ones,

14
0:02:18.400000 --> 0:02:27.920000
 but when it turns to face you. Okay. Yeah, I got it. Okay, it's okay. Okay, so we need to do six times.

15
0:02:28.560000 --> 0:02:34.640000
 I was going to do six times. Yeah, but I mean, I guess since you've already polished like the

16
0:02:34.640000 --> 0:02:41.920000
 other size, just polish like your remaining ones. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay, the remaining one is the

17
0:02:41.920000 --> 0:02:48.080000
 fours one and the fifth one. Can you? Hi, Tio. Can you help me turn turning again? Sure.

18
0:03:42.320000 --> 0:03:49.440000
 Okay. Thank you. Okay, I finished the fourth one and we have the last one to finish, which is

19
0:03:49.440000 --> 0:03:56.880000
 some surface five. Can you turn it again? Yes, I can. Okay. Please.

20
0:04:11.920000 --> 0:04:35.840000
 Okay. Okay. Thank you. Okay. I finished. I think we can't leave the task. Thank you.

21
0:04:35.840000 --> 0:04:45.920000
 Oh, you're great. All right. Yeah. Nice job. We're going to serve it. Yeah. Thank you, Thiago. Okay, response.

22
0:04:49.600000 --> 0:04:52.320000
 I'm happy to hear that. Oh, yeah.

23
0:05:06.640000 --> 0:05:08.960000
 Uh.

24
0:05:14.880000 --> 0:05:16.660000
 Please.
